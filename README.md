# way
There is my way of learning of Ruby.

All files include comments.

The main task of commented templates is to be easy-to-understand not only for me,
but for everyone who opened it and tries to understand.

All templates are based on Ruby Essentials.

More about Ruby Essentials (https://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Ruby_Essentials).

Another source I used is Ruby-Doc.
