# My way of learning Ruby.

This repository consists of Ruby files with comments which created by myself.

The main purpose is to help to understand the most common constructs of the language, to learn the syntax and rules of a good tone, to improve your knowledges.

These files helped me to learn the language, so I wish you found this helpful too.
