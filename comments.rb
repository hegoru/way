# Comment is any text that can't be executed and ignored by interpreter in Ruby.
# In a few words: comments are the notes of a programmer.
#
# There are two types of comments: single line and multi line.
# Single line comment is a simple line of text after hash (#) character.

=begin
There is a multiline comment.
It contains the lines between 'begin' and 'end' comment-markers.
Use it a little.
